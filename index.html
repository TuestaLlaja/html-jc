        <p>Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47
            prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city
            center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.

            Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo became Japan's
            political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there. A few decades later,
            Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor
            and capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were
            destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945.

            today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its
            visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums,
            historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green
            spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.
